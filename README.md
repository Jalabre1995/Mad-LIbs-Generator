# Mad-LIbs-Generator
Easy Project that cocuses on strings, varibales, and concatenation. The purpose of this project is to learn how to manipulate user-inputted data. The input could be anything, an asjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form.

Ex:
```
$ python mad_lib_generator.py
